Note: Replace :author_name :author_username :author_website :author_email :vendor :package_name :package_description with their correct values in README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE.md and composer.json files, then delete this line. You can run $ php prefill.php in the command line to make all replacements at once. Delete the file prefill.php as well.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.
